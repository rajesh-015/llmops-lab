  ### IMP Areas
  1. GitOps + Platform Engineering	(Git is source of truth)   
     
	2. Crossplane (instead of terraform) Infrastructure as APIs (K8S is source of truth)      

	3. Observability + AIOps    
  
  4. Event-driven architecture and API intelligence (Kafka + RabbitMQ) AWS Lambda
     
	5. AI Infra + Model Deployments (GPU, Model Inference, Vector DB, latency Optimization, model monitoring, scaling workload across cluster)
				(Ray Serve/K Serve/ Triton Inference Server)
				Deploy and Manage LLM Based application
			Build pipelines for prompts, model and inference
			Monitor:
				Cost
				Latency
				Model Quality
